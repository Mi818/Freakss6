Educational Platform / Interactive Game for young teenagers (and all other adolescents) 
I am a developer  with very little coding experience and a designer with very few design skills. 
Despite the lack of experience and skills, I am an ingeniuos writer, interested in all things hidden and  quick on picking up new knowledge. 
It is my strong belief that the web isnÂ´t a crazy enough place without me. 
It is my wish to make my stories available world wide and readible from every device and every browser.
